# Embedded Camera Systems

An open-source technical knowledge base for **embedded and IP camera systems**, with a strong focus on **video/audio compression, real-time streaming, and system-level architecture**.

This repository documents how modern camera devices are designed and implemented — covering the complete pipeline from **image sensors and ISP**, through **video/audio encoding**, to **network transport, embedded Linux firmware, and interoperability standards such as ONVIF**.

All content is written from a **practical engineering perspective**, emphasizing real-world constraints, trade-offs, and standards-based design commonly encountered in embedded camera products.
